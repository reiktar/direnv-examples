# Requirements 

For this to work Please make sure that you have direnv installed and loaded in your shell 
https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html

For onepasssword/1password examples the op commandline client will also need to be installed

# Once Installed
Please step through each of the directories from simple to more involved. Each directory will require you to do `direnv allow` inorder for the direnv to activate. Make sure to checkout the .envrc in all of the directoies as that is where the goodies are.
